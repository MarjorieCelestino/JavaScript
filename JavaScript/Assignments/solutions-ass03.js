/*
01 - Write a function to find the largest string in an array of strings making use of the reduce function. 
You can, of course, do it using a loop, but see how short your code can be if you make use of the filter function.
*/

/*
02 - Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of squares of those numbers. 
E.g. if the array passed is [1, 2, 3] then the function should return 14.
*/

/*
03 - Write a function that takes an array of numbers as an argument and filters and returns the even numbers in them.
*/

/*
04 - Write a function that takes an array and a criteria function(for filtering) and returns the array of those elements which do not fulfill the criteria. 
The criteria function should take any element as argument and return a boolean value.
